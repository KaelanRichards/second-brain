# Test Editor

This is a test to verify the CodeMirror editor is working correctly after migration.

## Features to test:

1. **Bold text** with Cmd+B
2. *Italic text* with Cmd+I
3. `Inline code` with Cmd+`
4. [Links](https://example.com) with Cmd+K

### Editor Functions:
- [ ] Auto-save (300ms delay)
- [ ] Focus mode (Cmd+Shift+F)
- [ ] Preview toggle (Cmd+Shift+P)
- [ ] Font size adjustment
- [ ] Selection toolbar

> Quote blocks should work too!

```javascript
// Code blocks
const editor = "CodeMirror 6";
console.log(editor);
```

If you can see this rendered correctly in preview mode, the editor is working! ðŸŽ‰
